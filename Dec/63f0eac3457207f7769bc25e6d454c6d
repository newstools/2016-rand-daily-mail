SOUTH Africa faces more uncertainty in the coming year thanks to global political trends that have seen the rise of Donald Trump and the surprise of Brexit.But Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan assured South Africans that the country was not at risk of a recession, despite its slow economic growth.Gordhan was addressing the National Union of Metalworkers of SA‘s national congress in Cape Town.“In 2017, it‘s going to be a difficult year, politically, geopolitically and economically speaking as well,” said Gordhan.He warned that as a result of Brexit and the election of Trump as the president of the US a number of trade deals may have to be renegotiated.In South Africa, the ANC was expected to undergo a bruising succession battle as various factions in the party were expected to back deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa or African Union Commission chairman Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to succeed President Jacob Zuma, the minister added.Gordhan said the global electorate was beginning to question the establishment because it didn‘t see the benefit of the wealth accumulated by the ruling elites. “[The electorate was arguing that] unless we see the benefit, we are going to vote for Trump, or we are going to vote for Brexit, or we are going to vote for the EU to be broken up, or we are going to vote for right-wing populist parties,” he said.Speaking about the South African economy, he said the country was '“in the process of recovering”.He added that the government and other stakeholders needed to work together to make changes.“We need to find areas where we can work together.“There are many areas of the economy that are doing well. There are other areas of the economy that are struggling and we need to find ways of helping struggling parts of the economy,” he said.He said South Africans also needed to question whether the country‘s problems were due to a lack of money, or money that was misspent by the government.Numsa president Andrew Chirwa told delegates earlier that Zuma was South Africa‘s “No1 criminal” and belonged in jail alongside disgraced Paralympic athlete Oscar Pistorius.“[Zuma] is singing Inde lendlela (the road is still long). He is right, the road to jail is long,” he said. - The Times Need to stay informed? Published by Tiso Blackstar and distributed
