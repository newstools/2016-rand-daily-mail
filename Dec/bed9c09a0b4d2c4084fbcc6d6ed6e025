AN SABC executive was forced to stand up, apologise and withdraw a statement that parliament‘s inquiry into the affairs of the corporation was nothing more than a “kangaroo court”, while another senior executive was labelled a “pathetic liar” by angry MPs.MPs had clearly lost their cool by the time SABC company secretary Theresa Geldenhuys gave evidence during parliament‘s inquiry into the SABC.“You have betrayed what corporate governance is all about and South Africans have witnessed someone who is a pathetic liar,” a clearly irritated Makhosi Khoza (ANC) said to Geldenhuys.Khoza was asked to retract her statement by committee chairman Vincent Smith. Khoza then rephrased her comment saying she found Geldenhuys to be “someone not to be a trusted witness”.Fellow MP Patrick Chauke said he did not “find truth in all that she said”.Smith then switched his attention to SABC group executive for human resources Mohlolo Lephaka, who had called the inquiry “a kangaroo court”.“Apologise unconditionally for using ‘parliament‘ and ‘kangaroo court‘ in the same sentence,” said Smith.Earlier, the inquiry had heard that former SABC CEO Lulama Makhobo was “persona non grata” in the organisation of which she was the senior executive and was so stressed by being undermined by former COO Hlaudi Motsoeneng that she looked as if she would “drop dead” at any minute.The relationship between Makhobo, Motsoeneng and former board chairman Ellen Tshabalala was raised by former board member Bongani Khumalo, who was the first to appear before the inquiry yesterday.Makhobo testified last week.“It is fair to say, important to state, that the chief executive of SABC, Ms Makhobo, was not well supported at all,” said Khumalo.He said people looked up to her to get direction.“But if she‘s browbeaten and her back is not straight because she does not enjoy the support, things don‘t go well at all ... She looked like she could drop dead at any time; she was a bundle of nerves,” said Khumalo.He said it became clear to him that Makhobo had had her “power, her prerogatives, her scope usurped” by Motsoeneng, who was then the public broadcaster‘s acting COO.
