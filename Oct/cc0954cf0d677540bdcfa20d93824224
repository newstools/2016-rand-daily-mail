10.22 ------ His apparatchik in the National Prosecuting Authority, Shaun Abrahams, has announced that the finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, has been summoned to appear in court to face charges over the 'rogue unit' within the SA Revenue Service. This move comes out of the blue following several months of prevarication. The Hawks announced that they had handed the case over to the NPA and asked Gordhan to appear before them for a 'warning'. He declined, saying he had answered all his questions. Abrahams said Gordhan had set up the unit illegally because SARS was not entitled to establish an intelligence capability. He said the unit had been set up to gather intelligence despite the offer by the National Intelligence Agency to undertake the work. It's obvious what happened here. Gordhan - then SARS commissioner - and Trevor Manuel - then finance minister - did not trust the highly politicised intelligence agency to undertake work on behalf of SARS. Zuma, weakened politically and entering the final, weak, phase of his presidency, is beginning his endgame. He and his cronies want their hands on the treasury. They want Gordhan to resign so that their lackey - probably Eskom boss Brian Molefe, can take over the treasury. By the time I finished writing this, the rand had lost 3% of its value and Abrahams had not even finished. South Africa can kiss its investment grade rating goodbye. This is the end of government, business detente. Brace yourself for a rapid slide. Need to stay informed? Published by Tiso Blackstar and distributed
